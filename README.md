# designmyass.js

## What?
designmyass.js shows the source code of your site to the user. Instead of seeing the rendered site the user only sees the site's code.

## Why?
You have a site and want to stop care about design and readability.

## How?
You can simply include the script anywhere in your document. For best performance put the script before closing the body tag.

```javascript
<script src='path/to/dma.js'></script>
```
